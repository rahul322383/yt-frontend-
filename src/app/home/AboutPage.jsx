      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rahul, a new student diving into the world of web development.
        This project is my journey to learn and build a cool video streaming app with
        React, Node.js, and MongoDB. 
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        This app includes features like video uploading, comments, likes, subscriptions,
        and more â€” kinda like YouTube but my own style! Itâ€™s all about learning, experimenting,
        and leveling up my coding skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Iâ€™m open to feedback and always ready to improve. If you wanna connect, chat about
        code, or just say hi, hit me up!
      </p>
